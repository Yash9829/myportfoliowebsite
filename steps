to make hamburger menu functional we write some js code in navbar using useState hook



after 1hr, after creating navbar and heroimg
we have to create footer section which is common to every page we have

after creating the left and right divs and corresponding elements in them noiw lets style them as we have to place them on left and right sides
to do that use
display: grid
grid-template-column : repeat(2, 1fr)
grid-gap : 40px

have to create simple and dynamic cards
